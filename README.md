## Intro

Time is often the most constrained resource in a development environment. The pressure to deliver can lead to skimping on best practices and proper documentation. This toolkit serves as a solution to such issues by automating trivial but necessary tasks. It aims to be a continuously growing resource, regularly updated to cover a wider range of use-cases.

## Prerequisites

The scripts in this toolkit are intended to be run in a Bash environment. They have been tested on both Ubuntu and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Technologies

The Technical Egoism Toolkit is built with the following technologies:

- Shell Scripting

- Technology-specific CLI tools

## Scripts

The scripts are grouped by technology and the sensible categories per each technology:

- [Git-Specific Automation Scripts](./git)

## How to use it

To use the scripts in this toolkit, clone the repository onto your local machine. Navigate to the directory of the desired script and execute it from your terminal.
